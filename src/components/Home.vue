    <h3>Are we truly Recycling Conscious?</h3>
    <p>Does this clutter look familiar to you?</p>

    <p>Despite campaigns and efforts made in raising the awareness of Singaporeans towards recycling, most people will likely find the recycling bin here to be a common sight.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, even with falling waste generation, Singapore's domestic recycling rates also fell from 22% in 2018 to 17% in 2019.</p>
    <p>This reflects a severe lack of recycling knowledge and efforts among Singaporeans and Recyclopedia is here to help.</p>
