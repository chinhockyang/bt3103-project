<h5>Aim of Recyclopedia</h5>
<p>Recyclopedia is a web application that aims to increase recycling rates in Singapore by addressing the problem of the lack of recycling knowledge and inconvenience of recycling.</p>

<p> We want to help Singaporeans locate nearby recycling bins, seek information on the various types of household items they can recycle and how they can do so. We hope to raise public awareness and personal responsibility towards recycling, and encourage more people to recycle, by making recycling enjoyable, easier and more accessible. </p>
